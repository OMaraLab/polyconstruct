# PolyConf examples

This folder contains several example scripts demonstrating the use of PolyConf.  All the files you need to run these examples are contained within this folder.

## Tutorial 01:  Building a linear polyethyleneimine polymer conformation using PolyConf

The first tutorial is an example of how to make a linear 128 unit polyethyleneimine chain using `PolyConf`. It is contained in the file `01_build_PEI_linear.py`

This tutorial showcases several approaches, including:

* building a polymer chain with `extend()`
* two strategies for building a pseudo-linear polymer chain using `extend()`
* using `dihedral_solver()` to adjust the polyethyleneimine conformation
* using `shuffler()` and `dihedral_solver()` to generate a random polyethyleneimine conformation

TYhis tutorial is all contained in a single script.  There are detailed comments discussing the strategies used, and the limitations of the resulting conformations.  You are encouraged to examine the conformations generated by this script in [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), or another visualization tool of your choice, to understand the strengths and limitations of the different strategies.

## Tutorial 02:  Strategies for building conformations of polymers with different types of tacticity, or copolymers with different monomer distributions

The second tutorial shows strategies for making polymers with different types of [tacticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacticity).  Using poly methyl methacrylate, this lesson showcases a strategy for making an isotactic polymer, a syndiotactic polymer, and an atactic polymer.  These strategies use two monomers, `MMAD_bonds.pdb` and `MMAL_bonds.pdb`.  

In these examples, the two monomers are enantiomers.  However, these strategies are also applicable to the creation of [copolymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer), where the monomers are chemically distinct.

This tutorial is split into four scripts.  Each script includes detailed comments regarding the strategy used.  After you read and execute each script, you should take a moment to examine the generated conformations in VMD, or another visualization tool of your choice.

### Building an isotactic PMMA polymer

`02a_build_PMMA_isotactic.py` shows a strategy for building an isotactic PMMA polymer, in which all monomers have the same tacticity.  The method is very similar to the approach used in tutorial 01.

### Building a sydniotactic PMMA polymer

`02b_build_PMMA_syndiotactic.py` shows a strategy for building a syndiotactic PMMA polymer, where monomers alternate between two different enantiomers.  

This strategy could be adapted to make an [alternating copolymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer).

### Failing to build an atactic PMMA polymer

`02c_build_PMMA_atactic.py` shows how to build an atactic PMMA polymer, with tacticity of the monomers distributed randomly along the chain.  

This approach could also be adapted to generate a [statistical copolymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer).

This tutorial will fail, intentionally!  We have chosen a specific random seed, which will reliably fail to generate a valid  starting conformation.  We made this decision to showcase some of the challenges in generating polymers wherte monomers are arranged in a random or stochastic order.  

There is a discussion at the end of this script, which contain several suggestions for addressing these challenges.  You should try implementing those strategies until you can successfully generate a valid starting conformation.

### Building an ensemble of starting conformations for an atactic PMMA polymer, using `extend()` with `linearise=True`


`02d_build_PMMA_atactic_with_linear_extend.py` showcases one solution to generate an ensemble of starting conformations for an atactic PMMA polymer.  

This example is one solution to resolve the difficulties showcased in `02c_build_PMMA_atactic.py`.  This strategy uses  `extend()` with `linearize=True` to produce a pseudo-linear conformation.   It then applies `shuffler()` and `dihedral_solver()` to generate an ensemble of five starting conformations for use in replicate molecular dynamics simulations.  

This type of approach could also be used to generate a [statistical copolymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer).
