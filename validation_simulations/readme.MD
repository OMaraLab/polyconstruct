# Validation simulation inputs

These files contain inputs for the validation simulations discussed in the manuscript *PolyConstruct: adapting biomolecular simulation pipelines for polymers with PolyBuild, PolyConf and PolyTop*.

In addition to these files, a user will need to obtain a copy of the version of the modified GROMOS 54a7 forcefield as published by the Automated Topology Builder.  These can be obtained from the ATB website at [https://atb.uq.edu.au/index.py?tab=forcefield_files](https://atb.uq.edu.au/index.py?tab=forcefield_files)
