# PolyBuild Examples

This folder contains example input .itp files for use with *PolyBuild*, and the output RTP database entries.

The use of *PolyBuild* is discussed in detail in the manuscript *PolyConstruct: adapting biomolecular simulation pipelines for polymers with PolyBuild, PolyConf and PolyTop*.

Documentation is also available in the [*PolyBuild* section](https://polyconstruct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/polybuild.html) of the [*PolyConstruct* Documentation](https://polyconstruct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
